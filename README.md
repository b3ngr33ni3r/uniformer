returns a key-value object from combined config file/argv values.

## How?

Just `npm install uniformer` and then call `require('uniformer')(opts);`

check out the examples below.



## options

__uniformer takes an options object__.  
  
    ```
    {
      file:'path/to/config.(json|yaml)'
    }
    ```
for instance:
    ```
    {
      file:'config.json'
    }

if you don't specify a file option, uniformer pulls its data from `process.argv`. If you specify both,
the config file values will be overriden by `process.argv` values.


## examples

it's super easy to use...__without config__:

    ```
    var uniformer = require('uniformer');
    var normalizedOptionsObject = uniformer();
    ```
will return `{machines:['server01','server02','localhost']} when your application is called like this:
    ```
    $ node application.js --machines server01 server02 localhost
    ```
or
    ```
    $ node application.js -machines server01 server02 localhost
    ```    
  
  
or __with config__:
  
    ```
    var uniformer = require('uniformer');
    var normalizedOptionsObject = uniformer({file:'config.json'}); //this could be a json OR yaml file
    ```
with a config.json that looks like:
    ```
    {
      "machines":['server01','server02','localhost']
    }
    ```
will return `{machines:['server01','server02','localhost']} when your application is called like this:
    ```
    $ node application.js
    ```
or will return `{machines:['server01','server02','localhost'],deploy:true} when called like:
    ```
    $ node application.js --deploy true
    ```    
__currently only relative path-ed config files are supported!__
